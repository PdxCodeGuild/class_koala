            <h2>About Patrick Marleau</h2>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Marleau">Patrick Marleau</a> is a Canadian born hockey player who was drafted by the <a href="http://www.sjsharks.com">San Jose Sharks</a> in 1997 as the number 2 pick in the NHL Draft right after number 1 pick, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Thornton">Joe Thornton</a> .  Marleau served as the team captain from 2004 to 2009.  Patrick Marleau was the youngest player to ever start in the NHL since his birthday landed at the cut-off date.  Marleau had played for the San Jose Sharks for a total of 19 seasons before he decided to test out the Free Agency market in 2017.  He signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2017 and he is currently waiting to <em>hopefully</em> get signed with the San Jose Sharks again to finish his career and <em>hopefully</em> with a Stanley Cup!
