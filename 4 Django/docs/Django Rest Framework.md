## Calls to your API

Django Rest Framework provides API endpoints for the same create, retrieve, update, delete, list actions we implemented in vanilla Django. Here are some Axios calls you can use with the default DRF endpoints, but make sure to use the DRF built-in API documentation website to explore all your options and test things out.

### List



### Create



### Retrieve



### Update



### Delete
